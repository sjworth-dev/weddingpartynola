      <h2>Booking & Availability</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How far in advance should we book?</h3>
        <p>For wedding weekends, we recommend booking 6-12 months in advance. Prime wedding season (spring and fall) books up quickly. The earlier you book, the better your options.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the minimum stay?</h3>
        <p>Most wedding party bookings are 2-4 nights. We typically require a 2-night minimum, with 3 nights being most common (arriving the night before the rehearsal dinner, leaving the morning after the wedding).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can we check in early or check out late?</h3>
        <p>Early check-in and late check-out are often available depending on the booking schedule. Let us know your needs when you inquire—especially important if you need the space for wedding morning prep.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there a security deposit?</h3>
        <p>Yes, there's typically a refundable security deposit collected before arrival. This is returned after checkout assuming no damage beyond normal wear.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Cost & Payment</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much does it cost per person?</h3>
        <p>When split among the group, private properties typically cost $100-175 per person per night—often less than individual hotel rooms. The exact cost depends on the property size and your group size.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do we split the cost among the wedding party?</h3>
        <p>Most groups designate one person (usually the maid of honor or best man) to book and collect payments. We recommend using apps like Splitwise or Venmo to keep track. Collect deposits early to confirm commitments.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's included in the price?</h3>
        <p>The rental rate includes the full property, all amenities (pool, kitchen, outdoor space), linens and towels, basic toiletries, and WiFi. Cleaning is typically included or charged as a flat fee.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are there any additional fees?</h3>
        <p>Beyond the nightly rate, you may see a cleaning fee and applicable taxes. Some properties offer optional add-ons like early check-in, additional cleaning, or concierge services.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>The Property</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How many people can the properties sleep?</h3>
        <p>Our properties range from 6-20+ guests. Each guest gets a real bed—we don't count pullout sofas or air mattresses in our capacity numbers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How are bedrooms assigned?</h3>
        <p>That's up to your group. Common approaches: first-deposit-first-choice, random lottery, or letting the bride/groom and their honor attendants pick first. Some groups charge slightly more for private rooms.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there enough bathroom space?</h3>
        <p>Our properties have 5-6+ bathrooms specifically to avoid the one-bathroom-for-everyone problem. For wedding morning prep, there's typically enough space for multiple hair and makeup stations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there parking?</h3>
        <p>Yes, all properties have on-site parking. Capacity varies by property—check the specific listing for details. We can also recommend nearby parking if needed for overflow.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can we use the space for events like a welcome party or brunch?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. The properties are perfect for hosting casual gatherings like welcome dinners, post-rehearsal parties, and morning-after brunch. Formal events with vendors may require additional approval.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Logistics</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How close are the properties to downtown / wedding venues?</h3>
        <p>Our properties are located in desirable New Orleans neighborhoods, typically 10-20 minutes from downtown venues. We can provide transportation recommendations for your group.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is the neighborhood safe?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Our properties are in established, well-maintained neighborhoods. We're happy to share specific location details when you inquire.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What about neighbors and noise?</h3>
        <p>We ask that groups respect quiet hours (typically 10pm) for outdoor music and pool activities. Indoor gatherings can continue later. These are real neighborhoods with neighbors who appreciate consideration.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can we hire a caterer or have food delivered?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The full kitchens make it easy to work with caterers or prepare your own food. Many groups hire a private chef for one dinner, order delivery for casual meals, and make breakfast at the house.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Wedding Morning</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can hair and makeup vendors come to the property?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. The properties have great natural light and space for multiple styling stations. Many bridal parties prefer getting ready together at the house rather than at a hotel or the venue.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there space for first-look or getting-ready photos?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The properties offer beautiful backdrops—from the pool and garden areas to elegant interior spaces. Photographers love having options beyond the typical hotel room.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What time do we need to check out on wedding day?</h3>
        <p>We work with you on checkout timing. If you need the space for getting ready on wedding day, we can often arrange late checkout or an extended stay. Just discuss this when booking.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Groups & Coordination</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Who should stay at the property?</h3>
        <p>Common configurations include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full wedding party (bridesmaids + groomsmen)</li>
          <li>Bridesmaids only</li>
          <li>Groomsmen only</li>
          <li>Close family members</li>
          <li>Out-of-town guests who want to stay together</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if someone in our group drops out?</h3>
        <p>We recommend collecting non-refundable deposits early. If someone drops out, the remaining group typically splits their share. Having a clear policy before booking prevents drama.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can we split between the bridal party and groomsmen?</h3>
        <p>Some groups book one property for bridesmaids and another for groomsmen. If you need multiple properties, we can help coordinate.</p>
