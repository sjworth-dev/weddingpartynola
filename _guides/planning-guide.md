Booking a private property for your wedding party is easier than coordinating a hotel block—once you know the steps. Here's exactly how to plan it.

---

## Step 1: Decide Who's Staying

Before you start looking at properties, know your group.

### Common Configurations

**Full Wedding Party (12-20 people)**
- Bridesmaids + groomsmen + couples
- Everyone together for the full weekend
- Best for close-knit groups who want maximum time together

**Bridesmaids Only (6-12 people)**
- Bride + bridesmaids + maybe a few close friends
- Focus on the bride's experience
- Getting-ready space is the priority

**Groomsmen Only (6-12 people)**
- Groom + groomsmen + maybe close friends
- Lower-key, more flexibility
- Pool and outdoor space often priorities

**Close Family (8-16 people)**
- Parents, grandparents, siblings
- More private bedrooms, less shared sleeping
- Accessibility considerations

### Who to Include

Think about:
- **Must-haves:** Who absolutely needs to be there?
- **Nice-to-haves:** Who would love to join if there's room?
- **Budget considerations:** Who can actually afford it?

Get firm commitments before booking. "Maybes" become headaches.

## Step 2: Set Your Budget

### How Property Costs Work

Private properties are rented as a whole, then split among guests:

| Property | Nightly Rate | 12 Guests | 16 Guests | 20 Guests |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Smaller (6BR) | $800-1,200 | $67-100/person | $50-75/person | — |
| Larger (8BR) | $1,200-1,800 | $100-150/person | $75-113/person | $60-90/person |

### Compare to Hotels

| Option | Per Person/Night | For 12 people, 3 nights |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| Hotel rooms | $150-250 | $5,400-9,000 |
| Private property | $75-150 | $2,700-5,400 |

**The math usually favors private properties**—and you get a pool, kitchen, and actual living space.

### What to Budget Per Person

For a 3-night stay:

| Expense | Per Person |
|---------|------------|
| Property share | $225-450 |
| Food contribution | $75-150 |
| Activities/Ubers | $50-100 |
| **Total** | **$350-700** |

---

## Step 3: Book Early

### The Timeline

| When | What |
|------|------|
| 12 months before | Best selection, best properties |
| 9 months before | Good options still available |
| 6 months before | Popular weekends getting tight |
| 3 months before | Limited choices, higher prices |
| Last minute | Good luck |

**For prime wedding weekends (May, October), book 9-12 months ahead.**

### What to Look For

**Must-haves:**
- Enough beds for your group (real beds, not sofas)
- Multiple bathrooms (especially for bridesmaids)
- Kitchen for group meals
- Common areas to hang out

**Nice-to-haves:**
- Private pool
- Outdoor entertaining space
- Good natural light (for getting-ready photos)
- Proximity to wedding venue

---

## Step 4: Collect Deposits

Don't book until you have money in hand. People who say "I'm definitely in" without paying often drop out.

### Payment Structure

| Payment | When | Amount |
|---------|------|--------|
| Deposit | At commitment | $100-150/person |
| Balance | 2 months before wedding | Remaining share |

### Who Handles Money

Designate **one person** (maid of honor, best man, or dedicated organizer) to:
- Book the property
- Collect payments
- Track expenses
- Handle refunds if needed

**Use Splitwise or a spreadsheet** to track everything.

### The Deposit Conversation

Send something like:

> "We found a great house for the wedding weekend. It's $X per person for 3 nights—way less than hotel rooms, and we get a pool and full kitchen.
>
> To hold the spot, I need a $150 deposit by [date]. Venmo to @[handle].
>
> No pressure if you can't make it work, but I need to know by [date] so we can finalize numbers."

### What to Plan in Advance

**Before the weekend:**
- [ ] Assign bedrooms
- [ ] Create grocery list
- [ ] Plan meals (catered, cooked, delivery?)
- [ ] Book hair/makeup vendors
- [ ] Confirm transportation to venue

**Someone should arrive early to:**
- Stock the fridge
- Set up any decorations
- Handle check-in logistics

---

## Step 6: Bedroom Assignments

This causes drama. Decide the system upfront.

### Options

**First deposit, first choice**
- Whoever pays first picks first
- Creates urgency to commit
- Can feel unfair to people who couldn't pay immediately

**Random lottery**
- Names in a hat
- Feels fair
- May not account for different room values

**Tiered pricing**
- Bigger/private rooms cost more
- Shared rooms cost less
- Transparent and fair

### Always Give Priority To

- Bride/groom (obviously)
- Honor attendants
- Anyone with specific needs (mobility, etc.)

### Communicate Early

Before the weekend, everyone should know:
- Which room they're in
- Who they're sharing with (if applicable)
- Bathroom situation

---

## Step 7: House Rules

Set expectations to avoid issues.

### The Basics

- **Quiet hours:** Music off outside by 10pm (neighbors)
- **Clean up:** Everyone tidies their own dishes
- **Respect the house:** You break it, you bought it
- **Smoking:** Usually outside only, designated areas

### For Wedding Morning

- **Bathroom schedule:** Who showers when
- **Getting-ready stations:** Where is hair? Makeup?
- **Timeline:** When does everyone need to be ready?

---

## Step 8: Getting Ready at the Property

This is one of the biggest advantages over a hotel.

### What You Need

**Space:**
- Multiple rooms with good lighting
- Full-length mirrors
- Outlets for tools

**Supplies:**
- Robes for getting-ready photos
- Drinks (mimosas, coffee)
- Snacks (keep everyone fed)
- Phone chargers
- Emergency kit (safety pins, stain remover, etc.)

### Photo Opportunities

Private properties offer great backdrop options:
- By the pool
- On the porch
- In the garden
- Interior staircase or living room

Tell your photographer about the space in advance.

## Step 9: Meals at the Property

### What Works Well

**Welcome dinner (Friday night)**
- After the rehearsal dinner, or in place of
- Casual, pizza or BBQ delivery
- Set up on the patio

**Breakfast (Saturday and Sunday)**
- Stock the kitchen with basics
- Assign someone to make coffee early
- Keep it simple: eggs, fruit, pastries

**Post-wedding brunch (Sunday)**
- Order catering or hire a private chef
- Or have someone set up bagels and coffee
- Last chance to be together

### Grocery List Basics

- Coffee and creamer
- Milk, juice
- Eggs, bacon
- Bread, bagels
- Fruit
- Snacks
- Plenty of water
- Champagne, wine, beer

Assign someone to shop before everyone arrives.

## Step 10: After the Wedding

### Checkout Logistics

- **Know your checkout time** in advance
- **Pack the night before** if possible
- **Assign cleanup tasks** so it's not all on one person
- **Do a walk-through** to check for left items

### What to Leave Behind

- Trash taken out
- Dishes done
- Property in good condition
- Key/code secured

### Settling Up

After the weekend:
- Finalize any remaining expenses (groceries, Ubers, etc.)
- Settle up on Splitwise
